### GAME STORE GLOBAL BETA

- **The Discord [game store beta](https://discordapp.com/store) is available to everyone!** Three years ago, we set out to bring people together around games. Now, we’re going to bring the games to you.

- **[Discord Nitro](https://discordapp.com/nitro) has evolved!** For $9.99 a month, gain access to a growing library of critically acclaimed games that we think you and your friends should play.

- **Don't want games?** For $4.99 a month, boost your account with [Nitro Classic](https://discordapp.com/nitro) and gain a variety of chat perks (these perks are included in the $9.99 plan as well).

- **Discord's Universal Library** is here to save you from having yet another launcher for your games. If you want, Discord can scan your computer for games. Then, you’ll be able to launch any of your games through Discord even if they require another launcher (Discord will boot the other launcher and game).

- **Fixed the lag when entering and exiting the Overlay.** This is good.

- **Added a little notification when the Overlay crashes** to get you back up and running in NO TIME.
